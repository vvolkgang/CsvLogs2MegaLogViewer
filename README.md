# Process Csv Logs for Mega Log Viewer Lite

Tool used to process CSV logs created by standalone car ECU's, so they can be opened by Mega Log Viewer Lite. I've been using this for my ME221 logs. Note: It's useless for Mega Log Viewer HD users.

Currently, [this](https://github.com/vvolkgang/CsvLogs2MegaLogViewer/blob/master/MslLogsFixer/Program.cs#L12) are the supported columns / values delimiters, which are auto-detected by the tool.

# How to use

There's several ways to use this tool

1. Drag and drop the log to the .exe
2. Just execute the .exe and paste the log file path
3. Run the .exe in the terminal with the log file path as an argument.


**If you like MegaLogViewer Lite, buy the HD version, it has lots of great features you'll appreciate! **
